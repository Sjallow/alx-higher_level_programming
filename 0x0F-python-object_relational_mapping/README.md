Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that maps data from an object-oriented language to a relational database. ORM is commonly used in Python applications to abstract database access, allowing developers to use object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to interact with databases.

Python provides several ORM libraries, including SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee. SQLAlchemy is one of the most widely used ORM libraries in Python, providing a comprehensive set of tools for working with relational databases.
